## CLI-Based Two-Player Vehicle Racing Game in PHP

**Project Brief**:  
Develop a CLI-based two-player racing game in PHP. The game begins with the players choosing a vehicle from a list provided in a `vehicles.json` file. Each vehicle has a maximum speed. The application will calculate the time taken by each vehicle to complete a given distance based on its speed, and then declare the winner.

**Core Features**:   
1. Load the list of available vehicles from a `vehicles.json` file.
2. Allow two players to select a vehicle each from this list.
3. Run a race using the selected vehicles.
4. Calculate the time taken by each vehicle to complete the race based on vehicle's speed.
5. Determine and display the winner.
6. Display the time taken by each vehicle to finish the race.
